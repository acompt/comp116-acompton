Are the heuristics used even that good?
The heuristics are pretty good, however they are not the best. For example the 
credit card scans pick up many things that are not actually credit card numbers
leaked in the clear. Because we use pattern matching in the log file we may get 
a bunch of false positives like the credit card scan. We were looking for
certain patterns and thus the alert would be triggered any time the pattern was
found and not necessarily only when something was leaked.

What would I add or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?
If I had more time I would add functionality to be able to check different
types of packets. I would also try to implement a different way to check for
credit cards that resulted in fewer false positives. You could even set up a 
service to have this program run in the background of your computer and send 
you a message any time there is an alert.
